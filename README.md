# 🧬 Synapse

A lightweight TypeScript utility to **spawn and interact with Python modules** from Node.js with a native, message-based protocol over stdin/stdout.

It creates isolated Python environments on the fly, manages their lifecycle, and communicates using efficient [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/index.html) serialization — ideal for ML/data pipelines, custom logic, or tight Node ↔️ Python integrations.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔄 Spawns Python scripts as subprocesses
- ⚡️ Reuses instances until explicit disposal avoiding spawn overhead
- 🐍 Creates a dedicated Python `venv` automatically
- 📦 Installs dependencies via `requirements.txt`
- 📡 Communicates using binary MessagePack over stdin/stdout
- ✅ Handles sequential and parallel message flows with queuing
- 🧹 Manages graceful and forceful termination with dispose

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
npm install @himalaya-quant/synapse
```

> Make sure `python` (>= 3.6) is available in your system path.

## 🚀 Usage (Node.js)

```ts
import { Synapse } from '@himalaya-quant/synapse';

const synapseInstance = new Synapse();
await synapseInstance.spawn('./py_test_module', 'main');

const result = await synapseInstance.call({ foo: 'bar' });
console.log('🟢 Python response:', result);

await synapseInstance.dispose();
```

## 🧪 Example: Python module

This file serves as a reference entry point (main.py) for your Python module used with Synapse. It contains the minimal logic required to receive and process messages from Synapse.

You can either:

- Use it as-is as your default entrypoint
- Or adapt it to your needs — just make sure to preserve the same message-handling structure.
  _Failing to do so may result in your Python process not receiving any input from Synapse_

**💡 Tip**: If you’re unsure or just getting started, simply copy this example as it is.
Replace the call to `my_custom_script(payload)` with your own function, and remove the sample `my_custom_script` definition.

### `main.py`

```python
import sys
import struct
import msgpack

################################################################################
# This function is just an example of what could be your script entrypoint
# You can create as many files you want and import them. They'll just work.
# This function should be deleted, and this file should be kept as minimal as
# possible. Just create your own script file, import it in this one, and call
# the entry point where this "my_custom_script" is called now.
################################################################################
def my_custom_script(payload):
    # Do something with the payload:
    # for example you can interpret it as a command caller
    # or just data to feed to your script
    # anything that is JSON"ish" will work
    print("Do something with the payload")

    # You can return any dict here, but remember
    # to map the correct keys on node
    return {"data": f"Processing result from py of payload: {payload}"}


def main():
    while True:
        length_data = sys.stdin.buffer.read(4)
        if not length_data:
            return

        payload_size = int.from_bytes(length_data, byteorder='little')
        raw_payload = sys.stdin.buffer.read(payload_size)

        if raw_payload:
            payload = msgpack.unpackb(raw_payload)
        else:
            sys.stdout.buffer.write(msgpack.packb("empty payload received"))
            return

        ########################################################################
        #                    PLACE YOUR SCRIPT LOGIC HERE
        ########################################################################
        result = my_custom_script(payload)
        ########################################################################

        send_message(result)


def send_message(message):
    payload = msgpack.packb(message)
    length = struct.pack("<I", len(payload))  # 4-byte little-endian
    sys.stdout.buffer.write(length + payload)
    sys.stdout.buffer.flush()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## 📁 Python module requirements

Each Python module directory should include:

- A Python script that serves as entry point (e.g., `main.py`), containing the
  message processing logic, and which calls your own script with each new message.
- A `requirements.txt` that contains at least the `msgpack==1.1.0` dependency
  and all your other dependencies
- Any other Python scripts files that you want to include and import

When calling `.spawn()`, the following happens:

1. If `.venv/` doesn’t exist, it gets created via `python -m venv`
2. Dependencies are installed from `requirements.txt`
3. The module is launched in the virtual environment

---

## 📕 Note on dependencies installation

To speed up the instantiation process, Synapse checks if a `.venv` directory is
already present. If so, it assumes that the dependencies are already installed,
skipping the virtual environment creation process, and the dependencies install.

Be sure to have no `.venv` directory present in the python module if you want
the dependencies installation process to run.

## 📚 API

#### `spawn(directory: string, entrypoint: string): Promise<void>`

- Starts a Python process from the specified entrypoint script inside the given directory.
- Automatically sets up `.venv` and installs dependencies.

#### `call(input: any, forceJSONParse = false): Promise<any>`

- Sends a serialized MessagePack message to Python and waits for a response.
- Handles both sequential and parallel calls safely.
- Optional, it allows forceful JSON parsing of the payload returned from python.
  Mind that by default MessagePack decodes the payloads into their native type.
  For example: a python list or tuple, will be converted into a native js Array.
  For this reason you should never need to forcefully parse the response, as
  long as you always return native structures from your python scripts.
  But if for some reason you'd need to return a JSON parsable string, and you
  want Synapse to parse it automatically for you before delivering the response,
  you can do it by setting `forceJSONParse` to `true`.

  ⚠️ Just keep in mind that this will impact performances. Parsing large
  payloads using `JSON.parse` is not efficient like decoding native structs
  leveraging MessagePack's protocol.

#### `dispose(): Promise<void>`

- Gracefully terminates the process.
- If it doesn’t exit within 500ms, it’s force-killed.

## ✅ Test Coverage (Jest)

The included test suite ensures:

- ✔️ Correct responses from Python
- 🔄 Sequential message handling
- ⚡ Parallel calls work as expected (with queueing)
- ❌ Error handling:
  - Calling before spawn
  - Missing directories, scripts, or requirements.txt

---

## 🔑 Design Notes

- Uses MessagePack for compact and fast I/O.
- Stdin communication starts with a 4-byte payload length (Little Endian), followed by the packed data.
- All stderr logs are passed through to a dedicated stream for debugging.
- Output is routed to a stream so the consumer can listen to responses or logs if needed.

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- [ ] Timeout per `.call()`
- [ ] Auto-restart on crash
- [ ] Create a better communication standard between python and node
- [ ] Replace current python entrypoint file with a python library that will take
      a callback function (your script main function), and handles the messaging
      aspects under the hood. This will intimidate way less than seeing that big
      python entrypoint template.
